## For this program we have used loops(for). 
In looping, a program executes the sequence of statements many times until the stated condition becomes false.
There are two types of loops- entry controlled loop and exit controlled loop. It is also called as a pre-checking loop.
For loop is a entry controlled loop as it checks condition before execution.
Syntax:-
##for(intialization;condition;updation)
##{
##//satements;
##}
